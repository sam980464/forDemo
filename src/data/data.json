The Hadeon eon lasted from four thousand and sixty seven to four thousand million years ago. The Archean eon lasted from four thousand to two thousand and five hundred million years ago. The Proterozoic eon lasted from two thousand and five hundred to five hundred and forty one million years ago. The Phanerozoic eon lasted from five hundred and forty one million years ago to present time. The second time scale shows the Phanerozoic eon broken up into the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. The Paleozoic era lasted from five hundred and forty one to two hundred and fifty two million years ago. The Mesozoic era lasted from two hundred and fifty two to sixty six million years ago. The Cenozoic era lasted from sixty million years ago to today. The Paleozoic era is further broken up in the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devosonian, Carboniferous and Permian periods. The Cambrian period lasted from five hundred and forty one to four hundred and eighty five million years ago. The Ordovician period lasted from four hundred and eighty five to four hundred and forty four million years ago. Silurian period lasted from four hundred and forty four to four hundred and nineteen million years ago.

The Carboniferous period lasted from three hundred and fifty nine to two hundred and ninety nine million years ago. The Permian period lasted from two hundred and ninety nine to two hundred and fifty two million years ago. The Mesozoic era is broken up into Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods.

The Jurassic period lasted from two hundred and one to one hundred and forty five million years ago. The Cretaceous lasted from one hundred and forty five to eleven million years ago.
